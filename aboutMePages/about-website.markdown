    <p class="center-content no-padding-paragraph" style="font-size:24px;">How the site works</p>
    <hr><br>
</div>

<p>Hi, firstly I am grateful you'd like to know how this website works; that either means you like the design or want to know what to stay away from :&#41;<p>
<p>The initial idea was a website with my coding projects and an associated blog. And that's exactly what it's turned into.More information on the foundations of the blog aspect can be found <a href="/food/" class="headertut" >here</a></p>
<p class="center-content no-padding-paragraph" style="font-size:24px;">What is Jekyll? And is there a Hyde...</p>

<p>
Jekyll serves as a static site generator with built-in blog functionality. Unlike cloud-hosted CMS platforms like WordPress, Jekyll operates as a command line tool on your local computer. It adheres to a specific directory structure and, when executed, transforms source files into a directory containing pure HTML pages, along with associated CSS, JavaScript, and other files. This output can be easily deployed to a cost-effective file server or in my case; Hosted on GitHub pages.

Simply run the Jekyll generator whenever you make changes to your source files. It takes care of tasks such as compiling Liquid templates into HTML, rendering Markdown into HTML, assembling pages using layouts and "includes" (components), generating paginated HTML pages for a blog, applying code styling, and more, and that readers... Is how this website was formed.</p>

<p>The outcome is a site, optionally featuring a blog, offering the convenience of templates and Markdown. This site can be hosted inexpensively or for free, and it delivers excellent performance since all pages are pre-rendered, so there is nothing to hyde.

<p>In a nutshell (hopefully not...)<a href="/food/" class="headertut" ><img src="windows cursor.png" alt="cursor" style="width: 17px; height; 17px;">food blog provides context</a>GitHub pages generates static sites which can be hosted for free! I only had to pay for the domain name(own name), the repo yourwebsite.github.io contains the input pages to the static site generator.</p>
