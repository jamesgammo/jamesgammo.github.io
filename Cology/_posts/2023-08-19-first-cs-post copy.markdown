Hi and welcome to my Computer Science blog. From the get-go, I'll get this off my chest: I love this field. I love how it can help people, how it can bring people from across the globe together, how it can make our own lives more fulfilling, and how Computer Science is a channel for creating some of the most beautiful things on the planet.

<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'"> Where it all began </h1>

Funnily enough, my interest really began when I worked at McDonald's just as I was starting my A-levels. McDonald's philosophy is 'family-friendly'(insider knowledge) but when food comes in under a minute it's eye-opening how incredibly fast it is; You especially know this when cooking a new bag of nuggets every 2 minutes. Combine this understanding of the workplace with a day learning about Operating Systems at A-level/GCSE, I was also reading Code by Charles Petzold at the time, the words concurrency, multitasking, and priority are circling the back of your mind. You have a moment of "Oh yeah... it makes sense why that's like that..." and "that uses the same principle as that" which were the exact thoughts of mine as I was working.

Here, me and the other cooks are performing actions with genuine concurrency like each of us a different core on the CPU. Timers on each batch cooker and managers calling are like asynchronous interrupts and System clock ticks and we use CFS scheduling philosophy to get the highest throughput of food on that conveyer belt as possible. Now, as I'm currently studying Operating Systems at University, how schedulers learn to schedule system jobs with imperfect knowledge is like how we used to put more apple pies down when a big rush was expected â€” you learn from the experience of interaction.

I remember explaining this to my Dad who picked me up after work; I enjoyed explaining my realization so much that since then, I've had two different mentoring roles within Computer Science, and am fascinated with this idea of implementing Computer Theory into our society and implementing organization and efficiency ideas from our society into Computer Theory.

I have lots of things lined up for this blog, loads of different topics I'm going to share and a great deal of expressions of interest I can't wait to get out there to inspire others.

As of now, I have no routine for updating the blog, but I assure you, what I aim to create in this space is pure passion and unwavering curiosity for a field of study and practical implementation that is so truly awesome.
