<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'">Attention soldiers</h1>
They say everyoone is a master at something, you just need to find out what this is. I belive this is easier said then done. Often we are immeresed in everything everyone has to offer about anything, wether this aligns within our personal scopes of being contentious to someone as they are your friend, actively engaging in a fun back and fourth thought train with your friend down the pub, or you are calling out someone on the internet with the worst possible take mankind has ever see, and you just cannot let it slide. 
<br><br>
There are two things that come as bi-product of this immersion and they are complements to the human brain. A new frame of perspective is that when we engage in behaviours, we consume with our senses. Sight of the person talking, hearing what they have to say, feeling the consumation of different opions rise from our gut as we get ready to voice our own opinion; The frame is what we see here is metaphorically stored as medium of experience or observation, and down at a granular level explosions of neurochecmial reactions. We process, have recency bias, short-term and long term memory of events form(Often not within the premise of a pub conversation), each uniquely subjective to us all but in there own right exist differently to everyone no matter how much they promise you something happened this way. This is one bi-product, and it's the form of memories and new pathways inside our brains. The second is recall, what has happened in the past we can recall at a moments notice, we remember how we felt, or feel the same way, we 'load in' the memory to our concious mind so we can relive the experience; without this, we could not align memories with adjectives nor could we analyse and relive how we responded in a situation and wether this was the right thing to do, or how well we partook in this activity.

I link this back to becoming a master at something, what can this be for you? I know personally seeing a 17 year old Yamine Lamal score for Spain at the same age I was thinking about the nostalgia of watching childhood cartoons, the 'mastery' gene was obviously not in my pool; as inevitbly my memory formation and recall of memory was lacking, and I belive it boils down to attention. 
<br>
<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'">Exploration</h1>
Personally, I pay attention to a lot of things, I have realised I often switch, loose, gain increase and omit attention to events and details, an intrinsic characteristc which often leads to overwhelming information, TOO MANY WORDS which I have trying to make sense. I get too tired and sleep. On the other hand, The ability to recall and memory formation into my working memory is a cool double edged sword, for I allow them to sit there and agglamate with other things I consume, conversations, media, experience align like a jigsaw (Not saying the pieces FIT however) to <i>anything</i> currently loaded in. This makes me somewhat okay at writing blog posts, but not the best at ignoring distractions I will admit.
<br>
You see, attention in the right places alows ideas to proliferate like a wave in society, it's not a matter of if but when something will happen, by diversifying our experience and consuming inter-diciplinary ideas stemming from just those places where you wouldn't think of saying boyoyoyoying or Eurika! it happens. Archemeidas gets in the bath and shouts <i>that word</i> when he finds out how to measure the volume of a crown for the king determining wether its pure gold or diluted silver. It's the working memory on behind the scenes which we need to feed ideas and subsequent propogation. 
<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'">What's that you say about a Temu order?</h1>
Attention is all you need was a revolutionary paper written by google in the lead-up to the splashing of the AI wave. AI is everything that the computer cannot do, and when it can it's simply just software. It explained how predictive modelling can tell the focal point of a sentence, the noun which is being talked about, and in what tense. For a frame of reference this can be imagined as the subconcious processing, the statistics resemble the gurging of our sensory experiences and ideas, and the output is the result of millions of transformers one after the other taking in the previous sentences as context in order to predict the next word. Abstractly the backend of the human mind, n no way is it close however, Aritificial General Intelligence is far beyond what we AI can currently achieve, I mean, can it go on Temu and impulsively spend money on takky bits which look well cool on the website and order this to the wrong address? No. I didnt think so, and that's only a feature of us humans, the highest level of generalised intelligence in the known universe, lol.
<br><br>
So I pay attention to my thought processes, what's currently going on up there, and inevitbly what can I master. Nothing comes to mind as I read my book, but I have an idea for a blog post and here I am. Proliferation! An idea machine! By utlizing the obessions of what I consume conciously, I can create inherit and counter-intuitive links between topics, this interdiciplinary door.

This is where my attention is at, and it's where I believe we can superstep current AI models to have the intrinsic power of recall and formation of information. What started with Language has become the beurgoning field within AI. RAG (Retrival augmented generation) explained here by ChatGPT :)

 within a context of a 3D space (Each word has a vector associated withit, with a mapping of vector value to a word)

 <br>
 creates recall of a particular combination of vectors (and the spaces / words they point) to form information embeddings, with the incooperation of the Leiden algorithm (An algorithm to agglamate nodes with a graph)<br>

AI can closed-loop form comparisons based on its recent topics creating new avenues between information, like the link of a good manager and a top athelete explored:
<br>
<a class="no-padding-paragraph headertut" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/antje_heimsoeth_what_managers_can_learn_from_top_athletes?subtitle=en">In this ted talk</a>
<br>
AI will explonentially learn the mechanisms of what makes two events similiar, and <i>how</i> a good manager can learn form a top athlete. In a nutshell create a technology that builds the biggest lego set out of all information ever - as everything is connected through something and everyone has something to offer about anything, just like I said at the start.  
<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'">Annddddd....</h1>
Over the course of the next few months, in conjunction with a work related decision machine project I am currently working on with a colleague, I will explore this avenue using new technologies, ideas and ways in which to proliferate the understanding of this new technology as we all indeed, are a master at something :D
