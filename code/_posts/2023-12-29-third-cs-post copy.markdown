Polyquine... Yes you heard me. Something that sounds like it was one of voldermort's horkruxs (Which were awfully chosen by the way). Is an outstanding area of compilation that upon hearing it, didn't believe it was possible. 

In my last blog entry, I mention a transpiler - This is a compiler which translates code between different languages. 

<p>Now... Imagine a language, which is valid in more than one programming language.</p>

<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'">James stop, you are talking rubbish</h1>

I'm not! imagine a world where C , C++ and C# are all cross compatible, imagine how much time this saves accumulated over the years.

"Hey, I wrote this program in C"<br>
"Nice"<br>

<b>Instead its:</b>

"Hey I wrote this program in C"<br>
"What one?"<br>
"C++"<br>
"Nice"<br>

On a side note, the progression of C from C++ as C++ is (++) C+1 language variation C# is C(++)(++) or C+2; then the amazing thing is this, ++++ for pluses stacked in a 2x2 matrix, is a #. Now I'll let that settle for a minute.

<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'">The 128 polyquine</h1>

This is a program. That outputs another program. Which outputs another. Doing this 125 more times. Until the original program is printed again. Which it then prints. 

<i>Ruby</i><br>
A language focusing on productivity and simplicity, used for web servers.<br>
<i>Rust</i><br>
Multi-paradigm general purpose language used for network programming and system programming<br>
<i>Scala</i><br>
Supports OOP programming and Functional programming designed to be concise. 

<p>The first three languages are the ones suggested above - note the difference. Now having a program which is translatable from a single source code that doesn't output another program and is purely cross compatible is almost impossible due to the tedious little syntax additions langaueg creators add just to be funny. Creating a program which outputs another program, like a continuosly evolving specicies adapting to its environment its so fascinating. The fact its 128, 2^7 a core binary value is used to represent bytes of 2^8 is like the cherry on the cake.</p>
