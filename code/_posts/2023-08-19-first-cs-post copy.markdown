Hi and welcome to my Computer Science blog, from the get go ill get this off my chest, I love this field, I love how it can help people, how it can bring people from across the globe together, how it can make our own lives more furfilling, and how Computer Science is a channel for creating some of the most beautiful things on the planet. 

<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'"> Where it all began </h1> 

funnily enough my interest really began when I worked in McDonalds just as I started my A-levels. Mcdonalds philosiphy is 'family friendly' but when food 'sometimes' comes in under a minute its also incredibly fast, you especially know this when cooking nuggets every 2 minutes - combine this understanding of the workpalce with a day learning about Operating Systems at A-level / GCSE - I was also reading Code by Charlez Pretzold at the time - the words concurrency, multi-tasking and priority are in the back of your mind, you have a moment of "Oh yeah... it makes sense why thats like that...And thats kinda familiar to that in a way" which were the exact thoughts of mine as I was working. 

Here me and the other cooks are performing actions with genuine concurrency like each we are different cores on the CPU, timers on each batch cooker and managers calling are like System clock synchronous calls, SJF scheduling philosiphy to get the highest through put as possible. Now as I'm currently studying Operating Systems at University, how schedulars learn to schedule system jobs with imperfect knowledge on job time is like how we used to put more apple pies down when a big rush was expected - you learn from experience of interaction.

I remember explaining this to my Dad who picked me up after work, I enjoyed explaining my realisation so much that since then, I've had two different mentoring roles within Computer Science; and am fascinated with this idea of implementing Computer Theory into our society, and implementing organisation and effieciency ideas from our society into Computer Theory. 

<h1 style="font-family: 'Share Tech Mono'" >Commitment</h1>
I have lots of things lined up for this blog, loads of different topics I'm going to share and a great deal of expressions of interest I can't wait to get out there to inspire others. 

As of now, I have no routine for updating the blog but, I assure you, what I aim to create in this space is pure passion and unwavering curiosity for a field of study and practical implementation that is so truely awesome.
